1. I have learned many things like, creating visual studio project, printing
   sentences properly, printing special characters like ", %, \. I have also 
   learned how to give spaces by putting \t command as well as how to go into
   next line by typing just \n command.Moreover I learned how to use Matrix 
   and WinSCP, how to submit files to professor and even how to make new 
   directories in the matrix.

2. SSH(PuTTy) is like a terminal which gives us access to our college server through
   matrix and I used it for the same reason, to access the matrix by joining
   the matrix.senecacollege.ca server from SSH. It is a very secure terminal
   and asks for id password everytime you try to access it.

3. SFTP(WinSCP) is like a workshop place where we manage our workshop files and
   store our written projects there and the files stored there is directly 
   accessible in the matrix. I used it to store my written program and also copy
   program in the matrix.
