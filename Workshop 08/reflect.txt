1. Reportdata 
	1)->Space allocated to integer type is 4 bytes and to double type is 8 bytes. Therefore, in ReportData structure there are three int type variables which will occupy 12 bytes. Furthermore, there are 6 double type variables which occupy 48 bytes memory.
	  ->Therfore, the total minimum memory assigned to ReportData will be 60 bytes.
	  ->struct ReportData
		{
    		int repSkuNumber;
    		double repPrice;
    		int repCalorie;
    		double pounds;
    		double kilograms;
    		int grams;
    		double totalServings;
    		double costPerServing;
    		double costCalories;
		};
We could improve passing of information to funtions by simply passing object by address which will acquire only 4 bytes of memory itself.
This will directly change the value in the structure and will not require excess address spcae for new copy.
This type of passing is done by using pointers to direct the alternate value in function to the location of value of originally declared variable.
For example : ( usage of it in displayReportData)
void displayReportData(const struct ReportData reportInfo, const int checkProduct)
{
	 printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf", reportInfo.repSkuNumber, reportInfo.repPrice, reportInfo.pounds, reportInfo.kilograms,
        reportInfo.grams, reportInfo.repCalorie, reportInfo.totalServings, reportInfo.costPerServing, reportInfo.costCalories);
}

2. We can simply direct the ouput in ReportData structure to CatInfo structure.
This can be done by using pointer to direct value to one variable location instead of assigning two different spaces for it.
to cite an example from my code, my structre is something like this:-

struct CatFoodInfo
{
    int skuNumber;
    double price;
    int calorie;
    double weight;
};

struct ReportData
{
    	int repSkuNumber;
    	double repPrice;
 	int repCalorie;
    	double pounds;
   	double kilograms;
    	int grams;
    	double totalServings;
    	double costPerServing;
    	double costCalories;
};
void displayReportData(const struct ReportData reportInfo, const int checkProduct)
{
	 printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf", reportInfo.repSkuNumber, reportInfo.repPrice, reportInfo.pounds, reportInfo.kilograms,
        reportInfo.grams, reportInfo.repCalorie, reportInfo.totalServings, reportInfo.costPerServing, reportInfo.costCalories);
}
